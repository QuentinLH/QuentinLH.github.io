---

In this article, we prove that Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors is \\( \Pi^1_1 \\)-conservative over~\\(\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma_2^0 + \mathsf{WF}(\epsilon_0)\\) and   over~\\(\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma_2^0 + \bigcup_n \mathsf{WF}(\omega^\omega_n)\\). These results improve theorems from Chong, Slaman and Yang and Ko{\l}odziejczyk and Yokoyama and belong to a long line of research towards the characterization of the first-order part of Ramsey's theorem for pairs.
