The infinite pigeonhole principle for \\( k \\) colors \\( \mathsf{RT} \\)  states, for every  \\( k \\) -partition \\( A_0 \sqcup \dots \sqcup A_{k-1} = \mathbb{N} \\) , the existence of an infinite subset \\(H \subseteq A_i\\) for some \\(i < k\\). This seemingly trivial combinatorial principle constitutes the basis of Ramsey's theory, and plays a very important role in computability and proof theory. In this article, we study the infinite pigeonhole principle at various levels of the arithmetical hierarchy from both a computability-theoretic and reverse mathematical viewpoint. We prove that this hierarchy is strict over \\(\mathsf{RCA}_0\\) using an elaborate iterated jump control construction, and study its first-order consequences. This is part of a large meta-mathematical program studying the computational content of combinatorial theorems.
