In this article, we prove that Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors is \\( \Pi^1_1 \\)-conservative over~\\(\RCA_0 + \BSig_2 + \WF(\epsilon_0)\\) and   over~\\(\RCA_0 + \BSig_2 + \bigcup_n \WF(\omega^\omega_n)\\). These results improve theorems from Chong, Slaman and Yang and Ko{\l}odziejczyk and Yokoyama and belong to a long line of research towards the characterization of the first-order part of Ramsey's theorem for pairs.
