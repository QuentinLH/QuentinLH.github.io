The search for the first-order part of Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors (\\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2\\)) has been a long-standing question in the field of reverse mathematics. \\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2\\) is known to be provable using \\(\Sigma^0\_2\\) induction but is strictly weaker than it. It also implies a statement called \\(\Sigma^0\_2\\)-collection (\\(\mathsf{B}\Sigma^0\_2\\)). However, whether \\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2\\) is conservative over the base theory \\(\mathsf{RCA}\_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0\_2\\) for arithmetic statements remains an open question.
In their 2016 article, Ludovic Patey and Keita Yokoyama showed that \\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2\\) was \\(\Pi^0\_3\\) conservative over the base theory \\(\mathsf{RCA}\_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0\_2\\). In this talk, we provide a sketch of an improvement of that result using an elaboration of the method of indicators, by showing that \\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2\\) is even \\(\Pi^0\_4\\)  conservative over \\(\mathsf{RCA}\_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0\_2\\).
